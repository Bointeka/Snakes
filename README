What I learned
Using javafx to create simple objects using the canvas.
Simple animation using AnimationTimer
Not everything needs to be visually represented within the application.
        I.e the board as an 2D Array of chars
        Allows for greater optimized code
Never use git rm -rf 

Mistakes
Forgeting to initialize ArrayList
Not thinking through the build of the application
        Had to redo the implementation of the code

Cell
Represents the position and direction of individual cells. Useful in tracking
the snakes position and movements as well as the food.

Window
Sets up the window using javafx and allows for the animation of snake.

Game
The game's main loop. Tracks keystrokes, status of the game as well as positions
the snake's cell relative to each other and the food.
